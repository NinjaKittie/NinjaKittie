- 👋 Hi, I’m @NinjaKittie
- 👀 I’m interested in ... nearly everything!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... HTML5, CSS, Python. About to start learning JS as well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at the moment. Familiarizing myself with different platforms and modalities at my own pace.
- 📫 How to reach me ... catch me if you can!
